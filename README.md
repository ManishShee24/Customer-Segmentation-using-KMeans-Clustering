# Customer-Segmentation-using-KMeans-Clustering
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a company's customers into groups based on common characteristics. The goal is to maximize the value of each customer to the business.

Customer segmentation can help marketing and sales teams reach out to customers more effectively. It can also help personalize marketing, service, and sales efforts to the needs of specific groups.

Customer segmentation can help with: 
(i) Identifying ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities
(ii) Establishing better customer relationships
(iii) Testing pricing options
(iv) Focusing on the most profitable customers
(v) Improving customer service
(vi) Upselling and cross-selling other products and services

Some examples of characteristics that can be used for customer segmentation include:- 
Demographics, Behaviors, Age, Industry, Gender, Interests, Spending habits.

A common example of customer segmentation is buyer personas. Buyer personas create fictional backstories about potential customers. They combine demographic data, like job title, with more psychographic data like motivations, preferred method of communication, and so on.
